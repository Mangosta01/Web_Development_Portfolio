# Web_Development_Portfolio


## Description

The Week 2 project consisted of creating a portfolio of work to showcase our skills to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position:

* Use of Flexbox, media queries and CSS variables

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

* Consolidate and organise CSS Selectors and properties to follow semantic structure
